# About

This is a personal project related to movies 🎬  
It combines a **Telegram movie search bot**, a **Telegram channel autoposter**, and a **Nostr autoposter**.

Users can search for movies by title or pick a movie directly from posts.  
Playback is handled via **vidking.net**, while movie metadata comes from **themoviedb.org (TMDB)**.

The project is written in **Python** and focuses on automation and API-driven workflows.

## Motivation

I enjoy working with **automation, Python, Telegram bots, Nostr, APIs, and movies** 🤖🎥  
This project brings all of those interests together.

Another practical reason: I kept losing bookmarks to movie streaming websites.  
Having everything accessible directly in **Telegram (and Nostr)** turned out to be simpler and more reliable 📌
